They were ver hands-on and Inever had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding,. It tool my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me leand a job as a full-tack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</h2>
